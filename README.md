Dispocam Filter V2 is a free web application, that provides filters and tools to make images look like they were taken on film. Created with simplicity in mind, many powerful features
from popular apps are replicated without the cost or unnecessary features. 

Dispocam Filter V2 is a follow-up project to my original [Dispocam Filter](https://sambender.net/dispoCameraFilter.html) project.
The goal of the original was to provide a quick as possible method for turning photos into disposable camera-appearing photos. I was dissatisfied with
all of the existing apps and websites to do so, both with their overly complicatedness and their results, so I decided to make my own. Version 1 will still be
running and updated some, but I wanted to iterate upon it to provide a more well-rounded experience. To make the transition from V1 to V2 easier, all of the options
from Version 1 are the defaults so the identical results can be produced in the same amount of time!


What does Version 2 add?
- 14 hand-selected color correcting filters
- Randomized lens dust and particle overlays
- 10+ Optical light bleed overlays
- Variable grain overlay
